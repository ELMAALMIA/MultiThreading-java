#Multithreading in Java
Multithreading in Java involves the concurrent execution of multiple independent tasks within a single program. 
Each task is executed by a separate virtual entity known as a thread, which shares the same memory space of the process it belongs to.
This allows threads to communicate and synchronize with each other efficiently.

#Key Concepts:
Threads: Virtual execution entities that execute tasks concurrently.
Concurrency: The ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
Shared Memory: Threads share the same memory space of the process they belong to, enabling communication and data sharing.
Synchronization: Mechanisms to coordinate the execution of threads and prevent data race conditions.
Thread Safety: Ensuring that concurrent access to shared resources is properly managed to avoid inconsistencies.

#Benefits of Multithreading:
Improved Performance: Utilizing available CPU resources more efficiently by executing tasks concurrently.
Enhanced Responsiveness: Handling multiple tasks simultaneously to provide faster response times.
Parallelism: Exploiting parallelism to execute independent tasks concurrently, leading to faster execution times.
Resource Utilization: Optimal utilization of system resources by executing tasks concurrently.
